After python is installed it must be added to the path. This can done in
Windows by opening your file explorer then right clicking your computer.
Select properties and open advanced system settings. Then go to the advanced
tab and click environment variables. In the system variables box, scroll down
to Path and edit it. DO NOT DELETE ANY CURRENTLY EXISTING ITEMS IN YOUR PATH,
IF THERE IS ANY DOUBT CLICK CANCEL AND TRY AGAIN. After your current path, type
a semicolon then paste the path of python.exe. By default this will be 
"C:\Python34" (without the parenthesis).

Once python is installed and added to your path it can be run with a simple 
double click.

                                   Text Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included text files are for example only. The myItems.txt file must be 
formatted with one item per line. Item names must be written as they are found
on wftrading.net or they may not be assigned the correct value. The sell list
file is not needed as it is deleted and recreated on each use of wfSellList.py,
it is intended only to show a sample output based on the default myItems.txt 
file.
